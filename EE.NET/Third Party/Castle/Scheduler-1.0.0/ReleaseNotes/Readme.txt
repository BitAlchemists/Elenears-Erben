Overview
========

The Castle.Components.Scheduler project offers a lightweight and reusable
general-purpose scheduling service that integrates well with most .Net applications.
It is similar in purpose to the Java Quartz job scheduling framework but
its implementation aims to leverage .Net idioms whenever possible.

The Scheduler service is intentionally kept relatively simple so that multiple
implementations may be offered and so that the operation of the service can be
easily mocked for testing.  The default implementation should suffice
for most purposes.


Documentation
=============

The API contains copious XML documentation regarding the usage of each component.

Thanks

Many thanks to the developers of the Quartz and Quartz.Net projects.
I have borrowed certain design ideas from these projects and found them to be
most excellent.  With any luck I haven't thoroughly corrupted their intent!
